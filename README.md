# MAL-score-scraper
I made this project when MAL's API access was down. It allows you to record the score of a particular anime with the datetime. It prints out this information in a CSV file so you can process the data into a chart.

# My goals
I would like to continue this project using libraries that can make charts so I don't have to rely on using Excel.
